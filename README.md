Front end repository of the EZWealth web app. 
The app aimed towards educating people on personal savings, stock market, and many other things finance. 
In addition the goal of the app is to give more power to the retail traders by providing webscraping abilites for SEC 10K's.
Some other features planned include ability to quickly pull any financal firm and automatically generate a pre-formatted DCF.
In addition there will be the ability to find company earnings on that day and display IV stats to see if people can 
pinpoint IV crushes to take advantage of.
